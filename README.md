# DesignASOs
The computational procedure proposed in this repository aims to streamline the entire process of designing ad hoc ASOs, from in-silico identification of potential target candidates to a list of customized ASOs to induce the intended ES events. Moreover, it takes into account cancer relevant features, such as mutation frequency in patients, holding special value for the design of ES-based therapeutic intervention in oncology. To this end, our approach incorporates state-of-the-art rules to identify the most promising candidate exons of a gene of interest, which is first classified in silico as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. Subsequently, specific ASOs are designed and tailored for selected ES events that can contribute to desired outcomes, such as generating oncogene variants that lack activity or tumor suppressor variants that could exhibit partially restored functionality. By combining these methodologies, our computational procedure provides researchers with valuable assistance in their efforts to develop innovative therapeutic interventions based on targeted ES.
